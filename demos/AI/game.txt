what are the minimum requirements for a game to be considered a game?
What a fascinating question!

Defining a "game" can be a complex and subjective task, as it's often tied to personal experiences, cultural context, and historical development. However, here are some minimum requirements that
might help establish a game:

1. **Interactivity**: The game must allow the player to interact with it in some way (e.g., clicking, tapping, pressing buttons). This interaction can be as simple as moving a cursor or as complex as
solving puzzles.
2. **Goals or Objectives**: The game should have clear goals or objectives that the player is trying to achieve. These goals can be implicit (e.g., "survive for as long as possible") or explicit
(e.g., "collect 10 coins").
3. **Feedback**: The game must provide feedback to the player about their progress, such as scores, levels completed, or rewards.
4. **Consequences or Penalties**: There should be consequences or penalties for not achieving the goals or making certain choices within the game. This can include things like losing health points,
running out of time, or failing a mission.
5. **Rules or Constraints**: The game must have rules or constraints that govern how it's played. These rules can be simple (e.g., "don't touch the edges") or complex (e.g., "follow specific combat
mechanics").
6. **Player Agency**: The player should have some degree of agency within the game, allowing them to make choices that affect the outcome.
7. **A Clear Start and End**: The game should have a clear beginning and end, with a distinct transition from one state to another (e.g., level completion, mission failure).

While these requirements might not cover every possible interpretation of "game," they provide a solid foundation for understanding what makes a game, in general.

Keep in mind that the definition of a game can vary depending on the context, culture, and historical development. For example, some people might consider puzzles or brain teasers to be games, while
others might not.
